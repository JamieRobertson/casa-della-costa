## Directions

### Detailed directions from Fumicino airport

From [Fumicino airport](http://www.adr.it/web/aeroporti-di-roma-en-/pax-fco-fiumicino) you go to the ring road - the A 90, and you head north. You leave the ring road and join the E 35. This heads North until it joins and becomes the E 45.

You follow this all the way north to Orte. This is a junction where the E 45 heads off to the North East. You stay on the E 45. Take care as you leave the slip road onto the E 45.

You then follow the E 45 all the way to the Umbertide exit. When you get to Perugia, make sure you stick to the E 45 and keep following the directions to Cesena, which is its ultimate destination.

Take the slip road off the E 45 at Umbertide. At the bottom of the slip road, turn left, and then first right and head along the Via Tiberina. This becomes a long straight road parallel with the railway line. At the big pink church (just past Bar Giardino), take the left and then sharp right and continue across the green iron bridge over the Tiber. [Patrick's](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1eIDu39BgRzm24ZGbEP6lnZseLWE&hl=en_US&ll=43.305544999999995%2C12.32250799999997&z=17) (Eoteca Wine Club) is on the right after the garage.

From Patrick's, go right then sharp left under the railway signposted to Preggio. Use the mirrors to check oncoming traffic.

You then continue for about 10 minutes, past the forest of signs and Polgeto Castle, and turn left onto our white road just after the quarry.

Take care at the first, steep, sharp left turn on the white road. Stay in 2nd gear and stay centrally positioned. The rest of the white road is fine - just take it easy and in no more than 2nd gear.

### From the north

Take the Promano exit from the E45, to Umbertide.

As you approach Umbertide, you will be driving parallel to the railway on the right. This road is Localita Corvatto, which becomes Via Venanzio Gabriotti.

There are several light-coloured 3-storey buildings on the left, one of which is Bar Pina.

There is a small carpark in front of Bar Pina. Just beyond this is the ERG petrol station.

Take the right turning opposite Bar Pina, under the railway bridge, signposted Preggio, Passignano and Migianella.

Follow this road for 10 minutes.

You will pass Castello Polgeto on the left. Stay on the main road - it has now become Localita Monestevole. You will pass a turning on the left signposted 'Monte Acuto'.

Around the next corner, immediately after the old quarry, take the left turning onto the white road. It's signposted in blue and white: 'Costa di Monte Acuto'.

Initially it's a steep swing up to the left, then it turns to the right. Follow it around the mountain, with fantastic views over the valley on the right.

There is only one occupied house en route, called Villa Costa Piccola, just before you get to ours.

Casa della Costa and Villa Costa Piccola are both named on Google maps (Note that the street view photos were taken before the fence and gate were installed).

Casa della Costa is the last house on the white road.

From the beginning of the white road to the house is about 5 mins.


### From direction Preggio

Follow the SP142 towards Umbertide, passing La Cantina on the left, then just after 'Tribewanted' at Monestevole you will see the white road on your right, signposted 'Costa di Monte Acuto'.
