The position of the house on the side of Monte Acuto has enabled access at a number of different levels and makes for an intriguing and very appealing layout.

The front entrance opens from the sun-drenched terrace and into the hallway.  A stone stair case leads upstairs.  Like all the rooms throughout the property the floors are beautifully tiled in terracotta and there are chestnut beams in all of the ceilings. 

To the left of the hallway an archway opens into the dining area, and then into the kitchen.
The kitchen has a dishwasher, a five-burner Rangemaster dual fuel cooker, a large fridge/freezer, and is very well equipped with a good supply of glassware and crockery.
 
To the right of the hallway at the other end of the house is the light and spacious sitting room. It has a wood-burning stove, large flat-screen TV, and a selection of books, DVDs and games.
At the far end of this room, double doors open onto the terrace.

The internal stone staircase leads up from the hall to the first floor, and then through to the back porch, laundry room, and tower bedrooms. There are double doors onto the back terrace.


### Bedrooms

The __Master bedroom__ is at southern end of the house. It has a superking sized double bed (180 cm wide) that can be configured into two singles if requested. This bedroom not only has views from the windows to the front and side of the house but also has direct access to its own terrace at the rear of the house. There is a large fireplace (no longer in use), as this room was the farm kitchen in the days when the family lived upstairs, keeping their animals downstairs.
The ensuite bathroom with the Master bedroom has a walk in shower, free-standing bathtub, bidet, toilet and basin.

The __second bedroom__ is at the other end of the property. It has the same bed arrangement as the Master bedroom. The ensuite bathroom has a walk in shower, bidet, toilet and basin.
An en suite dressing room provides storage.

The __third bedroom__ is in the ground floor of the tower, off the back porch. The two single beds can be configured into a double bed if requested; the beds are the same dimensions as the first two bedrooms. The adjoining bathroom has a walk in shower, toilet and basin.

A narrow staircase winds up to the __upper tower bedroom__. This is a romantic hideaway bedroom with Queen sized double bed. The ensuite has a shower, bidet, toilet and basin. This bedroom has its own entrance at the rear of the property.


<!-- A couple of steps lead down to the back porch, and off this the utility room with washing machine. -->

Double doors lead outside to the terrace at the back of the villa. This is the same terrace onto which the door from the Master bedroom opens.



### Relaxing outdoor swimming pool

Stone steps lead down to the outdoor pool - a fragrant oasis surrounded by lavender, rosemary and flowering shrubs.

There are eight elegant and comfortable sun loungers and a large umbrella beside the pool.

The Pool House has a snooker table in the upper room. There is also a small kitchenette with fridge. A metal staircase leads down to a lower room, with a shower and loo.

Further down the garden, beyond the Pool House there is also a ping pong table.

The main terrace runs along the whole of the front of house, and there is a large granite dining table and chairs, shaded by a bamboo awning. There is also a barbecue and eight more reclining, padded deck chairs.

The terrace extends around the side of the villa and there are steps that lead from here up to the back terrace. 

A path leads down to a gate, and beyond that there are many walks and trails around and up the mountain. The tiny ruined church of Madonna della Costa is 5 minutes walk. 

A 1 km gravel track leads from the main road to the gated entrance of Casa della Costa. From the gates there is a 300 metre through the olive grove to the villa, where there is ample parking space.



The property is set amidst some dramatic countryside with marked trails that lead directly from the property, both down into the valley and up the mountain to the summit.

For keen walkers, May, June and September are fantastic months here in Umbria. The temperatures are not too hot and the profusion of wild life, flowers and butterflies make this time of the year a delight for walking in the Italian countryside.

A welcome basket of basic provisions is provided for guests’ convenience.
